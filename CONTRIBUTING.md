# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest! This project doubles as a portfolio case study.

## Workflow
1. Open an Issue (bug/feature/task).
2. Create a feature branch: `feat/<short-name>`.
3. Open a PR using the template; link Issues and add screenshots/GIFs.
4. Keep commits focused and descriptive.

## Standards
- Lint + format (ESLint, Prettier).
- Tests for new logic where feasible.
- Document public endpoints and architectural changes.
